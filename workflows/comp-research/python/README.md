# Python workflow example

Anders Poirel,  25/07/2020

This is workflow developed for the [Flu Shot Learning](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/) 
machine learning competition on Driven Data. The competition's goal is to predict how
 likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and. Specifically, participants are asked 
 to predict a probability for each vaccine. Participants are ranked the 
 [ROC AUC score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) of their
  predictions on a hold-out test set.

This workflow shows examples of Popper automating common tasks in computational research:
- downloading/generating data
- using a Jupyter notebook
- fitting/simulating a model
- visualizing results
- generating a paper with up-to-date results

## Requirements

- Popper
- Docker
- Python > 3.6

In addition, for local experimentation:
- conda

## Reproducing the results

```sh
popper run -f wf.yml
```

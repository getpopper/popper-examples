# Computational Research in Popper

This folder contains examples of Popper workflows of intermediate complexity in  computational science.
Both attempt to reflect best practices for developing Popper workflows in computational fiels
- [python](https://github.com/getpopper/popper-examples/tree/master/workflows/comp-research-python) 
 is a machine learning workflow in Python using the Jupyter Lab IDE. 
- [rstudio](https://github.com/getpopper/popper-examples/tree/master/workflows/comp-research-rstudio)
 is a machine learning workflow in R using the RStudio Server IDE.

To adapt the approach demonstrated here to your own work, see the guide for [computational research with Popper]().

## Requirements

- Linux *or* MacOS *or* WSL2
- Docker
- Popper

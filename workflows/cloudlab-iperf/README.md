# `cloudlab-iperf`

This folder contains an example [Github 
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow that showcases how to run 
an experiment on [CloudLab](https://cloudlab.us). To execute this workflow 
locally on your computer, you can install 
[Popper](https://github.com/systemslab/popper) and 
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

To run this example, assuming you have an active account on CloudLab, 
define the required secrets in your environment (`secrets` attributes 
used in [the workflow](./main.workflow)), followed by:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/popperized/popper-examples
cd popper-examples/workflows/cloudlab-iperf
popper run
```

## Workflow

The steps in the workflow are the following:

You can also see the contents of the [`.workflow` file](./main.workflow). 
High-level description of the steps in the workflow:

 1. `"build context"`. Uses the [GENI `build-context` 
    action](https://github.com/popperized/geni/tree/master/build-context) to 
    create a geni-lib context that is used by subsequent GENI-based actions.
 2. `"request resources"`. Uses the [GENI `exec` 
    action](https://github.com/popperized/geni/tree/master/exec) to allocate two 
    nodes on a CloudLab site. This action also creates an Ansible inventory used 
    in the next step.
 3. `"run test"`. Executes an [Ansible 
    action](https://github.com/popperized/ansible) that launches an [`iperf` 
    Docker 
    container](http://networkstatic.net/measuring-network-bandwidth-using-iperf-and-docker/) 
    on each allocated node, executes an iperf test, and retrieves output files.
 4. `"teardown"`. Releases the CloudLab resources used for the test (using the 
    [GENI `exec` action](https://github.com/popperized/geni/tree/master/exec) 
    again).
 5. `"plot results"`. Plots results of the test using a 
    [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) Docker image.

The input scripts for each of the actions executed in the workflow are contained 
in the `geni`, `ansible`, and `gnuplot` subfolders. After a successful 
execution, the entire folder looks like the following:

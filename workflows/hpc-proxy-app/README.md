# Parameter Sweep Over An HPC Proxy App

This workflow exemplifies how to run a parameter sweep of an MPI proxy 
application (LULESH).

## Workflow

The workflow defined in [main.workflow](./main.workflow) consists of 
five actions:

  * **`install lulesh`**. Installs [lulesh][lulesh] with `mpi` support 
    using [Spack](https://spack.io/) via the [Spack Github 
    Action](https://github.com/popperized/spack).

  * **`install sweepj2`**. Installs the [sweepj2][sweepj2] parameter 
    sweep generation tool via `pip` using [python-actions][pygha]. 
    This tool takes a [Jinja2](https://jinja.pocoo.org/) template and 
    a parameter space to generate a list of job scripts, one for each 
    datapoint in the space.

  * **`generate sweep`**. Passes the [script template](./sweep/script) 
    and the [parameter space](./sweep/space.yml) to `sweepj2` to 
    generate the sweep in an `sweep/` directory.

  * **`make scripts executable`**. Changes the permissions of the 
    scripts generated in the previous step so they become executable.

  * **`run sweep`**. Executes all the files generated in previous step 
    by invoking the [`run-parts`][runparts] utility. The LULESH 
    application is executed by invoking `mpirun`.

## Execution

This workflow runs in a container runtime ([Docker][docker], 
[Singularity][singularity], etc.) and can be executed with the [Popper 
CLI tool][popper]. To add it to your project:

```bash
popper add popperized/popper-examples/workflows/hpc-proxy-app
```

And to execute it:

```bash
cd hpc-proxy-app
popper run
```

Sample output (trimmed to only show end of execution):
